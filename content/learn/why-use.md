title: "2: Why should I use it?"
---

If it's not clear already, you can use Juicebox to fund just about anything. But if that's not enough:

#### 1. You actually own your project.

When you create a Juicebox project, a *Project NFT* is minted to your wallet.
Only the holder of the Project NFT (i.e. the "project owner") can change how the project works.
In other words, **you are the only person who owns your project.**
Nobody can change your project's settings — not even JuiceboxDAO.

#### 2. It can't hurt, right?

Right now, the gas fee (Ethereum network fee) to deploy a Juicebox project is 0.007 ETH, or about $8:

If it's your first time using Juicebox, it may take you 10-15 minutes to deploy your project.

I think *most* people would agree that spending $8 and 15 minutes is worth having a transparent, programmable, globally accessible, uncensorable blockchain treasury that can scale to millions of dollars, mint custom NFTs, managing complex tokenomics **and** handle your payroll.

#### 3. It saves you money.

According to [this article by Gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/c/blog/top-crowdfunding-sites), popular fundraising websites respectively charge:

|Platform|Fees|
|:---:|:---|
|Gofundme|2.9% + $0.30 per donation.|
|Kickstarter|A 5% service fee, and an additional fee of 3% + $0.20 per donation.|
|Indiegogo|A platform fee of 5%, along with 3% + $0.20 per transaction (and an additional $25 fee on international transfers).|
|Patreon|A 5-12% Patreon fee, along with 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, and 5% + $0.10 per microtransaction (< $3).|
|[Gumroad](https://help.gumroad.com/article/66-gumroads-fees)|A 10% platform fee and an additional 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.|

**The Juicebox protocol fee is only 2.5%.**

But what's more:
- The fee only takes place on distributions to external wallets (when funds leave the Juicebox ecosystem). Letting your community burn their tokens to claim a refund? No fees. Sending funds to another Juicebox project? Also no fees.
- Fees are routed to the [JuiceboxDAO](https://juicebox.money/@juicebox) project. And just like when you pay other Juicebox projects, this mints project tokens, at the same exchange rate somebody directly paying the project would get. By paying fees, you not only fund further development of the protocol — you govern a little bit of it too. If you want, you can even redeem those tokens to reclaim a portion of the fees you paid.

#### 4. Juicebox is honest.

A Juicebox project keeps you accountable to your community. You're forced to clearly set terms, and have no choice but to stick by them. Everything is publicly accessible on the blockchain, meaning your finances **have** to be transparent.

Donors love this!
Why would somebody want to contribute to a charity that isn't transparent over one that is?
Why would an investor want to fund a project based on a rough balance sheet when they could see everything instead?

#### 5. It's flexible.

Want to raise funds over a four day period, with tokens getting slightly more expensive each day, and then have token issuance shut off completely for a 30 day period?

Want to start with token redemptions off, and then slowly turn them up over time as your community grows?

Want to start out as a fundraiser, and then convert into a treasury for managing payroll and receiving revenues on chain?

Not only can you easily do all of these things by using Juicebox, but you can easily switch from one to the other by changing your project's settings. When combined with crypto payments, this makes Juicebox powerful at almost any scale.
