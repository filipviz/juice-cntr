title: "1: What is Juicebox?"

You probably know Juicebox as the tool which helped projects like [ConstitutionDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/constitutiondao) and [AssangeDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/assangedao) raise thousands of ETH and issue tokens to their communities: it's a decentralized Ethereum protocol which was first deployed on July 15th, 2021 — since then, it has been used to raise more than 50,000 ETH, worth some 170 million dollars. For context:

1. The most successful Kickstarter project of all time received over 40 million dollars in 2022. Within its first year of operation, Juicebox had **multiple** projects raise more than 40 million dollars (the two DAOs mentioned above).
2. Excluding projects which haven't received any ETH yet, the average Juicebox project has raised over $375,000 (of course, the median is much lower).
3. Projects using Juicebox have [sent people into space](https://juicebox.money/p/moondao), created [innovative DeFi protocols](https://juicebox.money/p/slice), and even [built new versions of the Juicebox protocol](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox).

Despite its capabilities, **many misunderstand how the protocol actually works** — even people well-versed in DeFi.

## What is Juicebox?

Juicebox is a **programmable crypto funding protocol** which works a bit like Kickstarter, Patreon, Gofundme, Indiegogo, and Gumroad, but all in one. And it isn't only for $50m+ fundraisers — people have used Juicebox to:

- Democratize funding for [filmmakers and fans](https://juicebox.money/@studiodao).
- Run shared treasuries for [experimental art communities](https://juicebox.money/p/tiles).
- Sustainably fund [open source software projects](https://juicebox.money/p/slice).
- Replace a car by [selling NFTs](https://juicebox.money/@carpooltogether).
- Transparently acquire and manage [real estate](https://juicebox.money/@kgroupdao).
- Super-charge payment processing for [charities](https://juicebox.money/p/peace).
- Transparently manage [personal income](https://juicebox.money/p/johnnydao) (publicly making charitable contributions along the way).
- Support their [newsletter](https://juicebox.money/@blecreport).

Along with many, many other use cases. The protocol's fundamentals are relatively simple:

1. When people pay your project, they receive your project's tokens. Like other tokens, these can be used for governance or token-gated websites.
2. You can distribute funds out from your project, to the wallets or Juicebox projects of your choosing. You pre-define these distributions, but you can change them over time.
3. If people are unhappy with the direction your project is headed, they can redeem their tokens to claim a proportional share of the ETH in the project.

In practice, as the project creator, you have powerful controls over each one of these mechanics. You can change token issuance rates, redemption rates, distributions, and other project settings over time, leading to powerful and elegant tokenomics. You can also lock your settings in place for pre-determined amounts of time, guaranteeing to your community that you won't rug them. Juicebox lets you have as much control over your project as you might want, but it also lets you give up control when you need to.
